## Database Details  
we establish a comprehensive acoustic database for dental food impaction.    we recruited a total of 1200 volunteers, aged 20-60 years old, regardless of gender, the target region is between the first and second molar.      The same clinician adopts the same floss (Oral-B, 50 µm) to collect acoustic contact information on the proximal surfaces of the target teeth, which mainly includes two types of acoustic information: impacted teeth(n=1012) and non-impacted teeth (n=1023).      



## Database Status    
The database is provided for scientific research and will be made available in full after the completion of the research。   

Thank you for your interest in our work!
